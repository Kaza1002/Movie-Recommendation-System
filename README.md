**Movie Recommendation System (R + Shiny)**
Personalized Movie Recommendation System using R on the MovieLens Dataset (27K+ Movies)
This project builds a personalized recommendation engine that combines content-based filtering (TF–IDF + cosine similarity), item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF), and hybrid design concepts. It also includes full data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and deployment via an interactive Shiny Web App.

**1. Executive Summary**
This end-to-end data science project demonstrates how user preference modeling and content similarity can be applied to movie recommendation systems.
Using R, the system reads and processes the MovieLens dataset, generates TF–IDF vectors for movie metadata, and computes cosine similarity scores to find the most relevant movie recommendations.
The final product is a Shiny web application that allows users to search for any movie, view the top-N recommendations, and explore a “⭐ Must-Watch” dashboard of top-rated films.
Key results show that the content-based model achieved Precision@10 ≈ 0.73 and Lift ≈ 1.42× baseline, outperforming the collaborative filtering model in both accuracy and speed.

**2. Business Problem**
Modern streaming platforms face challenges in improving user engagement and retention through personalized experiences.
Without proper recommendation systems, users spend more time searching than watching, leading to lower satisfaction and churn.
This project addresses the need for an efficient, explainable, and scalable recommendation system that can:
Provide relevant movie suggestions based on user preferences or metadata similarity.
Identify trending and high-rated “must-watch” content.
Offer quick, data-driven insights for business decision-making.

**3. Methodology**
Step 1: Data Preparation
Imported and merged multiple MovieLens CSVs: movies, ratings, tags, links, genome-scores, and genome-tags.
Extracted movie years, cleaned genres, and calculated average ratings and vote counts.
Saved final merged dataset as merged_data_final.csv.

Step 2: Feature Engineering
Converted movie genres into one-hot encoded vectors.
Created a TF–IDF Document-Term Matrix (DTM) using tm, slam, and Matrix packages.
Removed sparse terms to optimize memory and processing time.

Step 3: Modeling
Content-Based Model:
Represented each movie as a TF–IDF vector of words from its title, genres, and tags.
Computed cosine similarity between movie vectors for ranking.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF):
Used recommenderlab to analyze user–item rating patterns.
Predicted Top-N movie recommendations for synthetic users.

Step 4: Deployment (Shiny App)
Built an interactive Shiny dashboard with the following tabs:
Content-Based Recommender: Search movies and view top similar ones.
Must-Watch Dashboard: Displays top-rated movies filtered by rating count.
Item-Based CF (optional): Generates collaborative recommendations.
Integrated dynamic filters, CSV export, and error-free UI.

**4. Skills Demonstrated**
Languages & Tools: R (≥ 4.3), Shiny, R Markdown, GitHub
Libraries: tidyverse, data.table, stringr, tm, slam, Matrix, recommenderlab, DT
Concepts:
TF–IDF vectorization
Cosine similarity and similarity matrices
Item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization
Dashboard design and deployment

**5. Results & Business Recommendation**
Metric	Content-Based Model	IBCF Model
Precision@10	≈ 0.73	≈ 0.61
Lift	1.42× baseline	1.18× baseline
Query Time	< 0.2 sec	≈ 2 sec
Interpretability	High	Moderate

**Findings:**
The content-based model performed better for metadata-rich movie catalogs.
It provided faster and more interpretable results due to its reliance on movie metadata.
The IBCF model was less efficient because of data sparsity but demonstrated potential for hybrid extension.

**Business Insight:**
This system can help streaming platforms increase engagement by recommending high-probability watchlist items and highlighting top-rated content across genres and years.

**6. Next Steps**
Hybrid Model: Combine content-based and collaborative insights.
Matrix Factorization: Apply SVD or ALS for latent feature extraction.
Deep Learning: Use embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT) for semantic similarity.
Cloud Deployment: Publish via shinyapps.io or Docker containers on AWS.
Power BI Integration: Create dashboards for business KPIs, genre performance, and engagement metrics.
